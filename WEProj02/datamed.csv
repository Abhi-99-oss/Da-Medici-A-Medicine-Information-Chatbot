aspirin,"Aspirin is a common pain reliever that belongs to the class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is often used to reduce fever, relieve minor aches and pains, and alleviate inflammation.Aspirin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that promote inflammation, pain, and fever."
acetaminophen,"Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used over-the-counter medication for relieving pain and reducing fever. It is commonly found in many prescription and non-prescription products, including cold and flu remedies, as well as various types of pain relievers.Unlike aspirin and other NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not possess significant anti-inflammatory properties. Instead, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain, which helps to reduce pain and fever."
ibuprofen,"Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. It is available over-the-counter and by prescription in various formulations, including tablets, capsules, and liquid suspensions.Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which play a key role in the production of prostaglandins. "
lisinopril,"Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, and to improve survival after a heart attack. It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more smoothly and reducing the workload on the heart.By lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow, lisinopril helps to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular complications. It is usually taken orally once daily, with or without food, and dosage may vary depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment."
levothyroxine,"Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland. It is also prescribed to prevent the recurrence of thyroid cancer and to suppress the growth of goiters.Levothyroxine works by replacing or supplementing the natural thyroid hormone that the body is unable to produce in sufficient amounts. "
metformin,"Metformin is a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the class of biguanide drugs and works by reducing the production of glucose in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in the body's cells.Metformin helps to lower blood sugar levels, control hyperglycemia, and reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve damage. "
atorvastatin,"Atorvastatin is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. It works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in cholesterol production in the liver.By lowering levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol) and triglycerides while increasing levels of HDL cholesterol (or 'good' cholesterol), atorvastatin helps to improve lipid profiles and reduce the accumulation of plaque in the arteries."
omeprazole,"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It works by reducing the production of stomach acid, thereby helping to relieve symptoms such as heartburn, acid reflux, and indigestion."
alprazolam,"Alprazolam, commonly known by the brand name Xanax, is a benzodiazepine medication used to treat anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and occasionally for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or anxiety associated with depression.Alprazolam works by enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter in the brain that helps to calm excessive neuronal activity. "
cetirizine,"Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, runny or itchy nose, and itchy or watery eyes. It is also used to alleviate symptoms of chronic urticaria (hives) and other allergic skin conditions.Cetirizine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that is released during allergic reactions. "
escitalopram,"Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with mood regulation, by blocking its reabsorption into nerve cells.Escitalopram is typically taken orally once daily, with or without food, and dosage may vary depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment."
warfarin,"Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger in the blood vessels or heart. It is commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other thromboembolic events in individuals with conditions such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.Warfarin works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver, thereby interfering with the body's ability to form blood clots."
sertraline,"Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder.

It is effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including streptococcal infections, staphylococcal infections, and pneumococcal infections."
zithromycin,"Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and sexually transmitted infections.
